    			<h2>PRODUCTIVITY</h2>
				<p>
					One of the most recognized benefits of implementing manufacturing 
					robots is the improvment in productivity and efficiency.. In most 
					cases, robots can perform tasks at greater 
					speeds than humans are able to and are not restrained by fatigue or 
					the need to take breaks. Movements for repetitive tasks are very 
					precise, and time is not lost for unnecessary travel. This precision 
					also improves the quality of the final product which leads to costs 
					savings due to less scrap materials. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="safety" class="impact hide">
			    <h2>SAFETY</h2>
			    <p>
			        Introducing robotics into certain tasks and environments can  
					reduce worker exposure to hazards. For instance, robots can replace 
					a person when production requires the use of hazardous materials or 
					exposure to extreme temperatures. Similarly, jobs that are very 
					repetitive or have poor ergonomics can be replaced by robots to 
					reduce the physical impact on employees. 
			    </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="quality" class="impact hide">
			    <h2>QUALITY</h2>
			    <p>
			        Robotics enhances product quality through precision and consistency. Their accurate, repeatable movements eliminate
					human error, which is especially important when assembling small or intricate products such as electronics or 
			        medical devices. This precision leads to fewer defects, less scrap material, and more reliable final products.
			    </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="cost" class="impact hide">
			    <h2>COST</h2>
			    <p>
			        Robots have a high initial cost that extends beyond the cost of 
					the actual robots. Engineering and installation costs during 
					implementation along with the cost of programming and startup 
					typically exceed the cost of the robot. There may also be costs 
					associated with an increase in scrap products during the testing 
					phase. Once the robot is installed and turned over to production, 
					ongoing preventative maintenance costs for labor, programming updates, 
					and spare parts inventory must also be considered. 
			    </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="downtime" class="impact hide">
			    <h2>DOWNTIME AND RELIABILITY</h2>
			    <p>
			        Working around robots can be dangerous if 
					the proper safety precautions are not put in place or if they are 
					bypassed. This could lead to workplace injuries, damage to other 
					equipment, scrap products, and production downtime. With the elevated 
					level of complexity found in the construction of manufacturing robots 
					including moving parts, sensors, actuators, and processors, there are 
					several points of failure which could lead to extended downtime and 
					loss of revenue in the event of a component failure.
			    </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="skills" class="impact hide">
			    <h2>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h2>
			    <p>
			        Hiring or outsourcing the technical expertise required for maintaining 
					or upgrading a robot can also be challenging, especially for rural manufacturers.
